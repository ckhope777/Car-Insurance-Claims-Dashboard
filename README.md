# Car-Insurance-Claims-Dashboard
Project explores the Car Insurance Claims dataset to derive actionable insights into claim patterns, customer behavior, and operational bottlenecks. Using Tableau, I designed an interactive, responsive dashboard that presents a logical flow of findings.

## Aim of the Project ##
 - To uncover meaningful insights from car insurance claims data.
 - To design a visual storytelling experience through Tableau dashboards and storyboards.
 - To provide Senior Management with a concise summary of findings and actionable recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## How the Goal Was Achieved ##
**1. Data Exploration**
 - Imported the Car Insurance Claims dataset into Tableau.
 - Cleaned and structured data for meaningful segmentation.

**2. Dashboard Creation**
 - Built interactive dashboards showcasing:
   - Claim frequency by region, type, and customer segment.
   - Total and average claim amounts.
   - Patterns in high-risk vs. low-risk profiles.
   - Temporal trends in claims to assess seasonality.

**3. Storyboarding**
 - Designed a logical flow of insights: starting from broad patterns, narrowing down to specific problem areas, and finally presenting recommendations.
 - Ensured visuals were responsive and easy to interpret for non-technical stakeholders.

**4. Summary & Recommendations**
 - Culminated the dashboard with strategic insights:
   - Identified high-risk customer categories.
   - Suggested process improvements in claims handling.
   - Recommended risk-mitigation strategies to enhance the efficiency of the claims system.

## Tech Stack ##
 - Tableau – for interactive dashboards and storyboards.
 - Excel / CSV – for raw dataset storage and preprocessing.
 - Data Cleaning & Preparation – handling missing values, formatting variables.
 - Visualization Techniques – bar charts, line charts, maps, KPIs, and dashboards.
 - Tableau Public – for publishing and sharing the interactive storyboard.
